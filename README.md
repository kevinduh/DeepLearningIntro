## Lecture Slides on Deep Learning

Kevin Duh (kevinduh-at-cs.jhu.edu) 

These are various slides I created for teaching deep learning circa 2014-2017. Some material are outdated, some are not.

Feel free to use the slides in PDF format, or the corresponding latex source files. Compile them by, e.g.:

```pdflatex 140114-ResearchSeminar.tex```
